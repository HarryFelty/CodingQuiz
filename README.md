# CodingQuiz

## Description

This project was designed to help gain practice using more advanced JavaScript, including using JavaScript to traverse the DOM and create elements. This project is also a fully functional quiz game that serves as entertainment. From this project, I learned much about how to create elements and add them to a page using JavaScript, how to utilize local storage via JSON, and how to implement multiple html and JS files. The main technologies used in the project include JavaScript, Bootstrap, and JSON.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

This project can be used to demonstrate how JavaScript can be used to create HTML elements, display them to the page, and store variables in local storage to be used later. It is also a good demonstration of how javascript can be used to traverse the DOM and access HTML elements and store them in variables. Of course, this project can also be used for entertainment and a quick, fun game.
